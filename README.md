# EasyAPI
A new generation of programming languages and SDKs powered by FlashE and Coffie APIs.

# Over View
Since EasyOS 3.0, we have developed CoffieAPI, which is available to all developers, and FlashE, a C++-based graphical programming language for EasyOS, which supports normal C/C++ output as well as EasyOS-specific "text windows", which supports Dynamic update, centered output, standard printing, click detection, and other SDK features with a few simple parameters.

# About Support
Updates about EasyAPI don't come very often, they are updated in almost every EasyOS update, which we currently support:

1. EO_Update with EasyOS update
2. Monthly updates
3. debug level updates (recommended that developers use)
